I affirm that I have not given or received any unauthorized help on this
assignment, and that this work is my own.

1. It takes some times for the program to run.

2. Due to the limited time, I am not able to make the image displayed with more variety, and hence all of the image view displayed the app icon. However, my design is supposed to have the image at the table view below the calendar to display an image representing the priority

3. The program detects tab and swipe event, so that you will be able to scroll the calendar, tab the thing and etc.

4. The weather uses the api key from dark sky and involves core location. It will capture the location at first, asking whether a user wants to allow location information. If yes, it will display the weather and temperature based on the location.

5. The two alerts involve are deletion and the alert for allowing location access

6. The calendar is built using the collection view, and clearly there is an extensive amount of table view

7. User defaults is used to keep track of the number of launches, which will be displayed in the about view

8. Launch screen displays only the icon of the app

9. Auto-layout works perfectly for all iPhones, but for iPad, due to my limited time, it does not look pretty, but at least it works....

10. The event portion below the calendar display events for this month and you can add using the add button at the bottom bar. You can also add things to the to do list, which pops out once you click a day in the calendar. You can also check the box to indicate you have finished that item. Deletion is allowed, with an alert warning.
